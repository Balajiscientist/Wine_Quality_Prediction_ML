# Wine_Quality_Prediction_ML
Contains red and white wine samples with features like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol, etc
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using Machine Learning models. By analyzing various chemical components, we classify wines into different quality categories.
